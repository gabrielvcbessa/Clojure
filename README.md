# Clojure

This repo contain some exercises that were done during my journey through clojure. 
All exercises are taken from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) or 
[4clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/).

Here are some good readings:

1. [Learn X in Y minutes, Where X=clojure](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure/)
2. [Clojure Design Decisions](https://gist.github.com/reborg/dc8b0c96c397a56668905e2767fd697f)
3. [Clojure Metaphysics: Atoms, Refs, Vars, and Cuddle Zombies](https://www.braveclojure.com/zombie-metaphysics/)
